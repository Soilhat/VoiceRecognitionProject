# Initialisation Dataset

First we needed to find a large dataset to train our models : we inally found it on the internet.

Each voice sample is stored as a .WAV file, which is then pre-processed for acoustic analysis using the specan function from the WarbleR R package. Specan measures 22 acoustic parameters on acoustic signals for which the start and end times are provided.

The output from the pre-processed WAV files were saved into a CSV file, containing 3168 rows and 21 columns (20 columns for each feature and one label column for the classification of male or female). You can download the pre-processed dataset in CSV format, using the link above.

```{r}
dataset <- read.csv("voice.csv")
dataset[1:10]
```

* duration: length of signal
* meanfreq: mean frequency (in kHz)
* sd: standard deviation of frequency
* median: median frequency (in kHz)
* Q25: first quantile (in kHz)
* Q75: third quantile (in kHz)
* IQR: interquantile range (in kHz)
* skew: skewness (see note in specprop description)
* kurt: kurtosis (see note in specprop description)
* sp.ent: spectral entropy
* sfm: spectral flatness
* mode: mode frequency
* centroid: frequency centroid (see specprop)
* peakf: peak frequency (frequency with highest energy)
* meanfun: average of fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
* minfun: minimum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
* maxfun: maximum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
* meandom: average of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
* mindom: minimum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
* maxdom: maximum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
* dfrange: range of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
* modindx: modulation index. Calculated as the accumulated absolute difference between adjacent measurements of fundamental frequencies divided by the frequency range
